TNO_CountryClosing_epilogue_USA_Chep_Success: "The winds of progress sweep across the United States. From New York to San Francisco, from San Antonio to Juneau, America's cities stand full of life and vitality. Their people bustle along well-paved roads and go to work at shining factories and offices. They enjoy leisure and travel great distances, ready to see where the road takes them. In these ways, Philip Hart and Chep Morrison leave America a transformed nation, better for their leadership.\n\nOf course, not every challenge has been defeated. War remains. Bigotry remains. Pain and human suffering still dot the globe. None of these monsters can be defeated, not permanently, but the torch of liberty seems to burn brighter than ever against the dark horizon. America stands ready for the challenges ahead."
TNO_CountryClosing_epilogue_USA_Chep_Failure: "The air across America is stale and smoke-clogged. From New York to San Francisco, from San Antonio to Juneau, America's cities stand in a state of decay. Public schools in the South sit under-staffed. Rust creeps into disused factories along the Great Lakes. The white and wealthy retreat to suburban enclaves while poorer minority communities are left behind, forced to contend with fewer resources and political disinterest in their condition. In these ways Philip Hart and Chep Morrison's grand ambitions have failed. Stagnation has taken hold.\n\nOf course, there will be more challenges to come. War remains. Bigotry remains. Pain and suffering still dot the globe. None of these monsters can be defeated permanently and, amid the chaos, the torch of liberty seems dim against the dark horizon. Whether America can address the challenges ahead will need to be a question for another administration."
TNO_CountryClosing_epilogue_USA_Schlafly: "Who are we? What are we doing? What have we done to each other? As tensions rise and arguments spill out onto the streets, many Americans are consumed by these questions. They no longer recognize their neighbors. They no longer recognize their country. They no longer recognize themselves. All is bile, anger, and frustration. Phyllis Schlafly, for better or worse, has exposed the rot at the center of the American system.\n\nOf course, this state of affairs raises questions for the decade to come. War looms on the horizon. Bigotry thrives. Pain and suffering dot the globe. None of these monsters can be defeated permanently and, in America at least, the fires grow and the threats seem stronger than ever. Whether this house divided against itself can stand or whether it will collapse onto its foundations is yet another question that will have to go unanswered until this radical new Administration finishes its term."
TNO_CountryClosing_epilogue_USA_Yock_and_Hall_Torture: "This country is broken. It is obvious in the haunted faces of every person in the street, in every dilapidated storefront and burnt-out church. People have lost faith in their neighbors, their communities, and their government. They have lost faith in America and the ideals upon which the Republic was founded. Soon, perhaps sooner than many expect, there will be a great reckoning. Each citizen will need to confront their sins.\n\nOf course, America's collapsing institutions will not stop the crises to come. Indeed, it's likely to worsen it. Wars will spread. Bigotry will endure. Pain and suffering will be meted out upon the innocent and guilty alike. With the torch of liberty extinguished, monsters of all kinds creep their way toward the world stage. What happens next, and what violent delights they inflict, remains a mystery—for now."
TNO_CountryClosing_epilogue_USA_Generic: "Вся Америка затамувала подих. Після хаосу і невизначеності 1960-х років країна, здається, вступає в нову епоху з новим набором подій. З'являються нові технології, здатні на величезне добро і зло. Нова плеяда лідерів починає приймати їхні команди. Нове покоління вперше заходить до кабін для голосування.\n\nЗвісно, попереду буде ще більше викликів. Війна залишається. Залишається фанатизм. Біль і страждання все ще розкидані по всьому світу. Жодного з цих монстрів не можна перемогти остаточно, але поки факел свободи може горіти на тлі темного горизонту, Америка може вистояти."

TNO_CountryClosing_epilogue_GNG_Morita_Success_Ending: "Guangdong glitters in the glow of neon lights and cathode rays, the hallmarks of a life increasingly defined by Sony and Cheung Kong. Morita Akio, Li Ka-shing, and Stanley Ho have done what many believed impossible - redefining the corporate experiment in their own image, casting themselves as the plutocratic stewards of a Zhujin society taking root in the Silicon Delta.\n\nBut even as Morita and Li look back at the nation they have built, the future approaches relentlessly. Two suns, one white and one red, rise high in the Asian sky, burning away any shadows between them. The liminal space between the Republic of China and the Empire of Japan grows smaller with every passing week; few dare ask what happens when said space disappears, for all fear that Guangdong will disappear along with it.\n\nIt is [GetYear], and the Two Zhujin of Guangdong face the challenge they have always had: survival, in the face of impossible odds."
TNO_CountryClosing_epilogue_GNG_Sony_Morita_Failure_Ending: "Even as Guangdong glitters, bathed in the neon lights of the nation built by Sony and Cheung Kong, Morita Akio is stalked by the spectre of ruin. Nearly two decades ago, he was banished from Japan, with Tokyo Telecommunications taken out from underneath him - and he has just barely survived a second brush with death at the hands of Ibuka Masaru.\n\nEven as Guangdong recovers from the Riots, the business of government is left increasingly in the hands of Li Ka-shing as the Chief Executive retreats to Sony headquarters. In Guangdong, where personal power is an extension of corporate power, the failed takeover of Sony is an existential threat that weighs far heavier on Morita than the growing enmity between Nanjing and Tokyo.\n\nIt is [GetYear], and Morita's thoughts are consumed by a single, burning certainty: Ibuka may have started their feud, but Morita will be the one to end it."
TNO_CountryClosing_epilogue_GNG_Sony_Li_Failure_Ending: "Guangdong is awash in light and color, but all Li Ka-shing sees are darkness and shadows, harboring murderers in the twilight spaces untouched by Sony and Cheung Kong.\n\nA lifetime ago, he claimed he would work for the prosperity of all Chinese willing to better themselves. Privately, he would have admitted that he would do anything for a taste of the prosperity the Japanese enjoyed - a luxury he gained from his partnership with Morita Akio. But now, surrounded by the empty space where his wife should have been, he finds that his prosperity is bereft of pleasure or meaning. Neither can Li bring himself to renew his promise to the people - not after it has cost him so much. He is lost, even as the threat of renewed hostilities between China and Japan looms just over the horizon.\n\nIt is [GetYear], and Li Ka-shing returns to work - in the forlorn hope that it can fill the gaping maw in his soul."
TNO_CountryClosing_epilogue_GNG_Matsushita_Success_Ending: "Matsushita Electric reigns supreme over Guangdong - and Matsushita Masaharu revels in knowing that all under heaven is his.\n\nWhere he once was one executive among many, sharing in the spoils of Guangdong's profits, now he towers over all of them, directing profit and prestige as he sees fit. His benevolence feeds his workers and rewards his allies; his wrath cares little for the suffering of malcontents and his enemies. With Matsushita Electric fusing with the state, the distinction between the personal, corporate, and common interest has faded into nothingness - a personal kingdom that, even as rumors of war sweep the streets, is Matsushita Masaharu's unvarnished triumph.\n\nIt is [GetYear], and Matsushita Masaharu has proven to the world - and the man whose opinion matters most of all - that he is his own man."
TNO_CountryClosing_epilogue_GNG_Matsushita_Failure_Morita_Ending: "Matsushita Electric reigns supreme over Guangdong - but Matsushita Masaharu fades into the background, a captain absent from the helm of his ship. Perhaps that accurately reflects the state of affairs - that it is no longer Matsushita Masaharu's ship, but Morita Akio's.\n\nTo rule with the sole purpose to pursue personal power is a simple goal, one that is easily understood - and one that is easily manipulated. Where Matsushita fancied himself the master of Guangdong in a time of peace, he clung to the heels of more principled men in a time of chaos - and quickly found his 'benevolence' being channeled for the benefit of Sony and Cheung Kong. He sits, but the documents he reads are not in his handwriting; he stands, but the words he speaks are not his own.\n\nIt is [GetYear], and the naked pursuit of power remains a principle as strong as any other - Matsushita Masaharu was simply an unworthy man."
TNO_CountryClosing_epilogue_GNG_Matsushita_Failure_Ibuka_Ending: "Matsushita Electric reigns supreme over Guangdong - but Matsushita Masaharu fades into the background, a captain absent from the helm of his ship. Perhaps that accurately reflects the state of affairs - that it is no longer Matsushita Masaharu's ship, but Ibuka Masaru's.\n\nTo rule with the sole purpose to pursue personal power is a simple goal, one that is easily understood - and one that is easily manipulated. Where Matsushita fancied himself the master of Guangdong in a time of peace, he clung to the heels of more principled men in a time of chaos - surrendering himself to the hard decisions Ibuka Masaru was willing to take. And as Matsushita went, so too did the section chiefs of the government and the executives in the Legislative Council.\n\nIt is [GetYear], and the naked pursuit of power remains a principle as strong as any other - Matsushita Masaharu was simply an unworthy man."
TNO_CountryClosing_epilogue_GNG_Ibuka_Persistence_Ending: "Ten generations after the creation of Adam God saw the earth had been tainted beyond hope. So he called upon a flood that lasted forty nights and forty days, tearing down all that he had created and making it anew.\n\nOf course, Ibuka Masaru knows that the tale was made up - but what thing on earth wasn't, anyway? Compassion? Trust? Morals? Pan-Asianism? People constantly come up with the most asinine of reasons to validate what they do, be it throwing incendiary bombs into storefronts or going to war over arbitrary lines on the East Asian map. If made-up things and made-up stories are what humanity finds comfort in, it is only fair Ibuka indulges himself in the same. Fujitsu Limited, then, is his Ark; its pristine blue-white lights are his great flood, drowning out all the colors and voices from his head, forever.\n\nIt is [GetYear], 4321 years since the great Noachian Flood - and, God willing, another is soon to come."
TNO_CountryClosing_epilogue_GNG_Ibuka_Reconciliation_Ending: "Ibuka Masaru had been as much a man of God as he had been a man of his own "vision"; both of which, he now realizes, are products of his own fantasy. He wanted a success story, and made Guangdong its unwilling actor. He jabbed marionette strings into its arm and dangled it around for a farce - all to the content of his own heart, or whatever that was left of it.\n\nIt is thus that, after the Riots have proven his grip on state affairs untenable, Ibuka has elected to loosen it altogether. Supporters have expressed nothing but relief; skeptics, on the other hand, decry wasted potential, social upheaval, and political uncertainty. There is one thing of which the Chief Executive is certain, however: better to let other voices speak to him than suffocate them all. Because a story is made of more than one person; otherwise, it becomes delusion.\n\nIt is [GetYear], and Guangdong's light will flicker and falter in the years to come. Maybe it is better that way."
TNO_CountryClosing_epilogue_GNG_Komai_Manchurian_Ending: "Komai Kenichirō may have borrowed the gun he used to seize control of Guangdong - and now, the loan has come due.\n\nEven as the petty tycoons of the Legislative Council squabbled amongst themselves, Komai Kenichirō has always served a larger power - and has always answered to their wishes. Mangyō and Nissan were never above underhanded tricks to eliminate the competition, making Komai their agent on the inside, to consume and subvert Guangdong's energy for Manchuria's benefit. With Komai safely in power, such an investment was obviously worth protecting from the chaos of the Riots - a convenient excuse to leash him ever closer to the powers that be in Xinjing. Whether through money, obligation, or outright intimidation, Komai will never forget who his true masters are.\n\nIt is [GetYear], and Guangdong enters a terrifying future under its new masters - one in Kōshu, and the other in Xinjing."
TNO_CountryClosing_epilogue_GNG_Hitachi_Personalist_Ending: "Komai Kenichirō may have borrowed the gun he used to seize control of Guangdong - but he has no intention of ever giving it back.\n\nThere is no room for petty squabbling or disunity - in either business or politics. The feckless executives of the Legislative Council were beyond saving, and Suzuki hadn't seen fit to finish the job, and so it fell to Hitachi to realize Guangdong's original design - to render a province and its people into replaceable cogs in a remorseless machine. There was violence, to be sure - but two can play at that game, and nobody questions Komai's methods now. Not LegCo, not Nissan, not Mangyō or Manchukuo or even Japan - Komai is sui generis, a corporate king anointed with the blood of thousands, while China grinds its teeth and sharpens its sword.\n\nIt is [GetYear], and Guangdong enters a terrifying future under its new master - with life and liberty sacrificed to the will of a single man."
TNO_CountryClosing_epilogue_GNG_IJA_Failstate_Normal_Ending: "As Guangdong was created by Japanese fiat, so too does it meet its end.\n\nWhere corporate limousines and coolies once ran through the streets, now tanks and soldiers stand watch at every major intersection. The blood in the gutters has barely dried, even as shots ring out intermittently from back alleys as the last of the rioters are executed for their crimes. The population wilts in the face of military control; the Chinese government rails at the heavy-handed Japanese intervention, even as Japan defends its actions as necessary in the face of revolution in the streets. If words fail, then the soldiers taking positions on the border will soon have their say.\n\nIt is [GetYear], and Guangdong has entered history - not for the circumstances of its existence, but for the ignominious nature of its destruction."
TNO_CountryClosing_epilogue_GNG_IJA_Failstate_Hitachi_Ending: "Як Ґуандун був створений японським фіатом, так і він зустрічає свій кінець - з вуглинками опору, що загрожують спалахнути пожежею, яка охопить всю Азію.\n\nТам, де колись їздили корпоративні лімузини і купе, тепер танки і солдати б'ються з партизанами на кожному кроці. Кров у водостоках продовжує текти свіжою, оскільки Китайці, які відмовилися миритися з кривавим правлінням Хітачі, в свою чергу, б'ються до останнього до переможного кінця. Після смерті Комаї Кенічіро не залишилося нікого, хто б взяв на себе відповідальність за рану, що плаче, якою є Ґуандун; Японці захищають своє втручання як необхідне зло (проти чого вони не говорять), навіть коли Китайці стягують війська до кордону з виттям обурення через страждання своїх братів. Дипломати перемовляються між собою, і незабаром своє слово скажуть генерали.\n\nНастав [GetYear], й Ґуандун увійшов в історію - не через обставини свого існування, а як примітка до жахливого кровопролиття, яке ще має відбутися."

TNO_CountryClosing_epilogue_ENG_Butler_Demo_Ending: "So much to do. So little time. Britain, lying in her gasping and atrophied form, has paid the ultimate price of keeping the devil you know too close to itself. But amidst this forlorn epilogue to the history of a Free England, there still lies a chance for hope. If only it could be said for certain.\n\nRab Butler, if that name means anything to anyone outside of Whitehall at this point, shall inherit the position ordained to him for decades, and churn all of the strength, vigour and skills left within him into a vision of a New Britain. From Day One, every facet of his inner circle has been fixed towards the goal of a socioeconomic revolution at the hands of a benevolent state. His adversaries, leftovers from the old system, must still be combatted.\n\nThe year is [GetYear], and Rab Butler has ascended to the greatest public office in the land. Britain now looks to the past, to the days when democracy ruled these fair isles. Yet Butler is old, a veteran of 40 years and his successor, once certain, now stands unclear. Britain stands at a crossroads, and only time shall tell where it will lead."
TNO_CountryClosing_epilogue_ENG_Wallop_Soccred_Demo_Ending: "Across Britain, an air of uncertainty hangs heavy. The people in the cities furrow their brows in confusion and worry as news of the new Social Credit driven economy filters out of Downing Street. The people in the countryside are left only to wonder what on earth 'ruralism' even means for them and their livelihoods. And what remains of any resistance to the government's new direction  - whether they be collaborator or not - lies broken and miserable, the stench of failure hanging heavy.\n\nGerard Wallop, on the other hand, has never been happier. And why should he not be? His dreams of breaking free from the chains of the last remnants of monetary power in favour of pursuing his true vision for Britain has come true. International finance cowers in fear, as they know that England and her stock will soon return to the fields that made them strong in the first place.\n\nThe year is [GetYear], and Britain has made her choice - although whether it is one she shall come to regret is yet to be seen."
TNO_CountryClosing_epilogue_ENG_Wallop_Britfash_Demo_Ending: "When Domvile perished and Nall-Cain was thrust into Downing Street, most believed it to be the death knell of an ailing establishment that had been on its knees since 1956. But to the shock of all - bar its members - the Old Guard has not only endured the crisis, but completely retaken their Parliamentary throne.\n\nIn their gilded halls and country estates, these men and women of the upper crust celebrate the ascension of their fourth Prime Minister, Gerard Wallop to power. They toast to another 20 years of glory, prosperity and power, now at last free to enact their vision for Britain without interference from meddlesome Pragmatists or traitorous Ideologues.\n\nThe year is [GetYear], and Britain's delusional masters, so long isolated in Westminster, now stand over the Kingdom as a sculptor would clay, ready to twist and warp it into their desired image. An image of a fascist empire that never was, covered in gold to hide the festering rot within - now about to become a terrible reality."
TNO_CountryClosing_epilogue_ENG_Fountaine_Demo_Ending: "Andrew Fountaine used to pray for moments like these. A nation broken, dejected and traumatized, given a hero to deliver it. The opportunity to step in and show the British people - and indeed, the entire world, what a truly modern example of Fascism could look like.\n\nFor decades, this nation was merely just a fantasy to Fountaine - a man stuck in his mind in a country where many thought a nation engulfed by Fascism could not be rebirthed into another stage of the ideology, merely shambling along from one stagnated line of thought to another. The uprising proved these people wrong, however. The final piece needed for the decades-long puzzle Fountaine had been trying to solve was placed in his back pocket. All he needed to do was place it into its slot.\n\nThe year is [GetYear], and Fountaine steers the path to Britain's future. Her destination seems so obvious, and yet so obscured. All that can be certain is that Fountaine will follow his dream to the very end - no matter what. Wherever that leads Britain is anyone's guess."
TNO_CountryClosing_epilogue_ENG_Jordan_Demo_Ending: "We are in our homes now, looking out. We don't understand what we see. Out there: shudders and shakes. We can't hear over the noise. In here: shivers and chills. We can't sleep having heard. And the dictator is on the radio every day. He's promising unity but we're sure it's a straitjacket. He's offering peace but we're sure it's blackout curtains and curfews again. Nothing he is saying aligns with what we see.\n\nThe world is in fast motion, impossible to apprehend. Metal and concrete turn to liquid and swirl around our feet. We are looking out at the colors on the skyline, at the tyrant's circling pen. He'll be pointing it at us, soon. Be treating us like blank paper.\n\nThe year is [GetYear], and we do not know what ruin tomorrow will bring. But we must reach out. We mustn't stress. Mutual care is the only hope we have, so let's help one another be what we want to be, and something different from this."

TNO_CountryClosing_epilogue_Ukraine_Brautigam_victory_UCW: "Reform has won the day in Ukraine as Bräutigam's surprising victory puts the nation on a new course to freedom. Yet the Reichskommissariat remains, its history of exploitation and ingrained racism remains, and all its institutions have only been solidified since its victory in the civil war. To most outside observers, it is colonialist to its core.\n\nTo the eternally idealistic Bräutigam, these are only temporary roadblocks to his continued success. He leads Ukraine, and his agenda is focused on alleviating the problems of its oppressed people. At his most optimistic, he believes in devolving power back to the Ukrainians for a chance at democracy. Anything is possible now.\n\nAs long as Germania gives him their permission, he wouldn't want to force them to exert their power if its bottom line was threatened."
TNO_CountryClosing_epilogue_Ukraine_Leibbrandt_victory_UCW: "For all of Leibbrandt's work in outwitting his opponents and crushing partisan groups, his reward is unenviable. He inherits a broken Ukraine, one torn at the seams by civil war, and a people who have long since given up hope for their share at the table, only desperate for crumbs to feed their families.\n\nLeibbrandt promises to solve all of their ills, to uplift the nation along Rosenbergite lines while remaining true to Hitler. An easy promise to make, a harder one to fulfill as his Ukrainian sympathies take second place to his colonial mission - a contradiction he dutifully ignores. It is meaningless when Leibbrandt already knows the truth: National Socialism will solve all of Ukraine's problems.\n\nBut will this alleged truth mean anything to a nation that has already lost everything when its chance at true freedom was crushed under an iron boot?"
TNO_CountryClosing_epilogue_Ukraine_Ohlendorf_victory_UCW: "If one is curious about the fate of nations under fascism, one needs only look to Ukraine for the answer. The brave partisans rose, the brave partisans fought, the brave partisans starved, and then the brave partisans were massacred. Once again, her people are in chains, their broken bodies driven face down into the mud, and their spirits mutilated.\n\nAnd what do the monsters behind their enslavement have to show for it? The second hunger plan, the napalm floods, and brutal legions have re-secured the Reich's breadbasket, but the victors have naught but a country's corpse for their efforts and, worse yet, have learned nothing from their tribulations.\n\nOnce again, the National Socialists have subjugated Ukraine, and once again, their legions are exhausted, their conquests are unruly, and their leadership is divided. The victor of this power struggle will face a mountainous battle ahead of them if they wish to avoid another uprising and humiliation, and much more blood to be shed. Here lies the answer to fascism's future: a boot stomping on a human face, for all eternity."
TNO_CountryClosing_epilogue_Ukraine_communist_victory_UCW: "Victory is what the masses cry, victory is what the soldiers shout. Victory is what Shumskyi announces over the radio as statues of Erich Koch and Adolf Hitler are destroyed.\nBut victory cannot feed the masses, victory cannot bring back the dead.\n\nUkraine is a wasteland, destroyed by war, ravaged by disease. The wounds caused by the hunger plan and 20 years of genocide run deep, and the idealism of the soldiers and theories of communism cannot heal this. The Germans scorched the earth as they retreated, burning fields, leveling cities and blowing dams. Destiny has handed the task of rebuilding Ukraine to the communists. They need years, they only have months. Already German forces regroup and gather, planning the reconquest of Poland, Ostland and then Ukraine.\n\nThe year is [GetYear] and the specter of fascism threatens to swallow Ukraine whole once again."
TNO_CountryClosing_epilogue_UPA_Klyachkivsky_victory_UCW: "After decades of tears, Ukraine's most loyal sons finally reclaimed her from her defilers and avenged her greatest champion, Stepan Bandera. But they know this is only the beginning. Dealing with the degenerates, the traitors, and the invaders have cured Ukraine of her diseases, but she remains in pieces.\n\nThis cannot be allowed to stand while the hive of scum and treason in Germania still breathes. Another confrontation with the Third Reich is inevitable, and every inch of Ukraine is needed for our Final Victory. Our commanders, regardless of their differences, know what must be done.\n\nThe wayward territories of our homeland lie scattered, stolen away by races of filth and deception; Poland, Hungary, Romania, and what remains of the Germans in Crimea, and it will ALL be reclaimed. We will offer these cowards a final chance to wash their hands of sin, should they refuse, we will raze them to the ground. The year is [GetYear], no matter the cost in resources, time, or martyrs, we will make Ukraine whole or scorn the world trying."
TNO_CountryClosing_epilogue_UPA_Shukhevych_victory_UCW: "Klyachkivsky was a rabid dog, driven insane by a maddening vengeance disguised as love for Ukraine, he had to be put down before he destroyed our nation. Stetsko was a sniveling worm, a rat who would sell his mother to the Germans for a sliver of power. Shukhevych was the only one worthy of the title Vozhd, only he could carry Ukraine's mantle.\n\nThe new Vozhd inherits the Herculean task of rebuilding unity in a country dragged through the mud for twenty years. Unity is the only thing the Vozhd has that will keep the Ukrainian people loyal against the German rot that has consumed the land. Shukhevych's speeches extol this principle above all else, but the question remains. Can a unity be strong enough to stop the inevitable march of a returning German infection ready to engulf all of Ukraine?\n\nThe year is [GetYear], and this question will soon be answered."
TNO_CountryClosing_epilogue_UPA_Stetsko_victory_UCW: "For too long, Ukraine has been without a guiding light. Since the death of Bandera, the UPA and Ukraine have been left rudderless, sliding into oblivion. The triumph of Stetsko has changed all that.\n\nKlyachikivsky recognized the power buried in the blood and soil of Ukraine, but blinded by hatred, knew not what to do with it. Stesko has found a way to harness this power along rational lines. National Socialism is not just an ideology it is a science, a blueprint for the formation of an organic racial state.\n\nBut the path to glory will not be easy, racial chaos in Ukraine is overwhelming. Stetsko is certain that if the Reich gave him the time, his people will join their Aryan brothers on Olympus. Though only a fool would put the fate of a race in the hands of another. A briefcase of reichsmarks and a revolver sit ready, should the Führer have a lapse in judgement. It takes only the will, determination, and patience of a single man to save a race, Stetsko will ensure Ukraine joins Germany in the sun."
TNO_CountryClosing_epilogue_UNRA_Dziuba_victory_UCW: "The Ukrainian culture was once regarded by the bureaucrats of Germany as a dormant symptom, soon to be swept away by the National Socialist cure during the sixties. Under the Republican tide, it has seen its rebirth. Now reforged from civil war, the Republic of Ukraine has escaped from dreams into reality.\n\nThe helmsman of this cultural revolution is Ivan Dziuba, a leftist, a populist, and most importantly, a nationalist. His goal is to sustain the energy behind the revival of a once-dying culture through his distinctive brand of politics. Their land will see the prosperity it rightfully deserves, a land where Ukrainians are proud of who they are and a land where a nation can be perfected.\n\nBut beyond these dreams of a great tomorrow, one must wonder if Dziuba knows how this new Ukrainian renaissance will survive Germany's inevitable return..."
TNO_CountryClosing_epilogue_UNRA_Ohloblyn_victory_UCW: "The Ukrainian National Revolutionary Army has fought hard and long, and they have managed to establish a nation defined by freedoms and powers that the German government would never have allowed. Yet the Spivators, a party of former collaborators with only limited democratic credentials, has managed to worm its way back into power. Once in Kiew as servants, the Spivators enter Kyiv as ministers and presidents.\n\nPresident Oleksander Ohloblyn has made his first and only priority clear. Ukraine must find its way back into Germany's good graces, at any cost. This herculean task will require reshaping the Republic not towards revolutionary progress, but to fit the tastes in far-off Germania. With the NSDAP remaining as rabid and fascistic as ever, a republic that bows to Germany can be no republic at all. The year is [GetYear], and without even a German invasion, the Ukrainian revolution is already being snuffed out."
TNO_CountryClosing_epilogue_UNRA_Stus_victory_UCW: "Peace is such a fragile thing, and cooperation is even more so. The UNRA has driven the Germans out of their homeland and brought the Banderites and Communists to heel, but the divides of ideology are proving too great for them to overcome. Perhaps it was too much to hope that an alliance between social democrats, liberals, and collaborators could last for long.\n\nHowever their disagreements and differences evolve, they and all must remain wary; time waits for no man, and great calamity is coming. The thunder of the Nazi war machine is growing louder, and its return to Ukraine is a matter of when not if.\n\nOne way or another, an accord must be reached among Ukraine's leaders and perhaps even between the newly freed nation and the Reich. Dreaded and loathed as it may be, if an accord is not reached between Ukraine and Germany by word, it will be done by the bayonet. May God be with Ukraine as she approaches her darkest hour, for no one else will."

TNO_CountryClosing_epilogue_MEX_Demo_Ordaz: "Mexico continues on its implacable course, set firm by the Revolution, as its captain passes control to his trusted first mate. The new hands, steady on the wheel, are those of Gustavo Díaz Ordaz. He has earned the respect of the crew with tireless vigilance, a keen intellect, and precise orders.\n\nThe PRI tells this story, hurriedly and relentlessly, amidst the gathering storms. They do not speak of the leaks springing up, the guerillas multiplying, the crew intriguing for rank and favor, the whispers... the whispers that Ordaz may be cracking under the strain.\n\nHis face of stone shows no sign as he navigates the Scylla of radicalism and the Charybdis of reaction. The howls of foreign powers or Mexico's passenger-citizens cannot release his iron grip. The course is set; the dark night does not allow deviation.\n\nFor [GetYear] and years to come, Ordaz, the PRI, and Mexico will plow through any obstacles in the Revolution's way."
TNO_CountryClosing_epilogue_MEX_Demo_Lozano: "President Raúl Salinas Lozano has snapped the fetters that bound him: Secretaries Echeverría and Chumacero, the twin banes of his administration, may as well be counted among the corpses at Madera. But so can the truce between his modernizing technocrats and the PRI's stifling orthodoxy.\n\nTwin wars now begin - each fought in the shadows. In windswept fields and sprawling slums, a Dirty War, as security forces hunt the radicals inspired by the GPG's martyrdom. And within the party, from the smallest municipal office to the National Palace, a battle for the future of the Revolution unseen since Celaya.\n\nThe year is [GetYear]. López Mateos' peace is gone, but what shall take its place? Salinas' vision of a prosperous and dynamic Mexico free of the ghosts that haunt it, or the tightening fist of an old order determined to never again lose its grip? Perhaps only the wasteland their struggle leaves behind."
TNO_CountryClosing_epilogue_MEX_Demo_Madrazo: "The Southern Cyclone's relentless momentum has choked on the hot, dry air of Chihuahua. An unexpected blow by the Guevarist GPG has left Carlos A. Madrazo's revived Revolution reeling, exposed and endangered by its host of enemies on the right. Corrupt corporatists, reactionary synarchists, and, above all, the governors now in open defiance of his authority threaten to drag the Mexican nation into the darkest days of its past.\n\nBut his storm has also breathed new life into the Revolution's dying flame, and this backlash has awoken its true defenders. Titans of old and today's zealous youth join to hold its guttering torch aloft, to fight and die for the shared dream of a just and independent Mexico.\n\nIt's [GetYear], a time when chaos and smoke obscure the way ahead, and hide both friend and foe. But that bright beacon, that hope of finally fulfilling the promises of the Revolution's heroes, summons Madrazo ever onward."
