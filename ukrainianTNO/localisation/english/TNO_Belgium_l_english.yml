 ### Leader Bios ###
 POLITICS_LEON_DEGRELLE_DESC:0 "Leon Degrelle began his political career as the leader of the Rexist movement within Belgium, a far-right, Catholic political party, heavily influenced by Fascist and Corporatist thought. During the war, Degrelle proclaimed Rexism to be a close friend of National Socialism, choosing to collaborate with the occupiers of Belgium and join the Wallonian Legion, quickly rising up within the ranks of this organization to become its leader. After the war ended, Degrelle became responsible for the rule and control of much of southern Belgium under the Reich, as one of the most influential collaborators in all of the Einheitspakt.\n\nNow, with Wallonia fully integrated into Heinrich Himmler's Ordenstaat, Degrelle continues to exercise control over the lands as commander of the SS-Wallonien collaboration brigade. Though Degrelle has competently and ably served the Ordenstaat in their adoption and application of the Burgundian system, the Reichsführer-SS has grown suspicious of the Belgian. With how important Degrelle has grown, however, Himmler has been unable to get rid of him without proof that the man is plotting something."
 
 POLITICS_LEON_DEGRELLE_COLLAPSE_DESC:0 "Who would have thought that Leon Degrelle would have made it this far? Not many, least of all the man himself- but he's here now, and he has one chance to succeed.\n\nLeon Degrelle was torn on the German invasion at first, along with his party, but he grew into one of their most ardent collaborators with time. An Iron Cross recipient, a war hero, and a proud advocate of the Wallonian people, suffice it to say that Degrelle was heavily displeased with the news that his lands were to be put under the control of Heinrich Himmler and his acolytes- a displeasure that has only grown with time, as Himmler's spartanist Aryan ideal ground Wallonian culture and independence into the dirt.\n\nAt first, Degrelle tried to covertly undermine Himmler's work, subtly stocking arms and preparing his men for an uprising. This was revealed, despite his efforts to keep it hidden, and Degrelle and his men have been on the run ever since. Even as they have succeeded in hiding from the SS brigades that hunt for them so far, Degrelle thought it was only a matter of time until they found him, he and his men were playing for time- that is, until the Ordensstaat collapsed in spectacular fashion, and a faint hint of hope broke through.\n\nIn the chaos of the split, Degrelle and his men have seized Wallonia from Himmler's clutches, setting up their forces for the inevitable counterattack. There is only one hope for the Walloon Division now- to fight off Himmler's and the other factions' assault together. If, for whatever reason, this endeavor fails, then Degrelle and the Walloon Division will certainly die- and Wallonia may go with them."

 ## Ideas ##
 BEL_restorationist_fervor:0 "Restorationist Fervor"
 BEL_restorationist_fervor_desc:0 "Degrelle longs to see Belgium reborn under his own auspices, cleansed of unwanted elements and elevated to the status of equal with the Reich. Such an aspiration seems unlikely in these times, but Degrelle has never been one for action rather than talk."

 BEL_high_in_honors:0 "High in Honors"
 BEL_high_in_honors_desc:0 "Degrelle and the Walloon Legion are highly respected within the SS. They are the most famed collaborator legion by far, having proven their valor time and again against the Bolsheviks in both the Second World War and West Russian War."
