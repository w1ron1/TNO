 ### LEADERS
 ########################
 
 POLITICS_ADOLFO_LOPEZ_MATEOS_DESC:0 "Adolfo López Mateos was either the child of a dentist and teacher in Mexico City or a bastard from Guatemala who faked his Mexican heritage to fulfill his political ambitions. The story is under dispute, with the later theory having special prominence amongst his detractors. However, the documents he provided in the only official inquest into this in 1946 evidentially was enough for him to be placed above suspicion. This minor speed bump did not stop his ascent from secretary to the State of Mexico's governor, to its senator and President of the PRI, the main Mexican ruling party. From there, it was a mere matter of friendship and dutiful service to President Ruiz Cortines to place him as his successor, which guaranteed him an easy election not atypical for the PRI.\n\nLópez Mateos' term was marked with a continuation of the economic success and stability of previous Presidents overall. Land reform, the building of museums, expansion of healthcare and education, and the nationalization of the electrical industry were all major successes. And he was also able to keep Mexico in its position between the Sphere and the OFN, which ended up serving Mexico well, and may even end up being recognized as the critical factor that prevented conflict between the two nations.\n\nHowever, not all has been well. Relations with the PRI's Union support base have soured. And student groups collide with the government. Some are concerned the PRI is blindly running away from the policies that have been successful for Mexico. And now, Adolfo López Mateos must take all of this into account, in order to make his most critical decision: who will succeed him in the Presidency of Mexico?"

 POLITICS_LUIS_ECHEVARRIA_DESC:0 "To much of the world, Luis Echeverría Álvarez is a chimera, a stitched-together symbol of everything wrong with the PRI. To the people of Mexico, he is much the same, but he portrays himself as everything right with the PRI. Born in Mexico City in 1922, Echeverría joined the party as a young man. He quickly gained favor in the office of the Party President, and over the decades, he would move from job to job, culminating in a stint as Secretary of Exterior Relations. Now, as President of the United Mexican States, he seeks to establish Mexico as a truly independent nation, insulated from the great power conflicts of the present age, and secure in its neutrality. The American and Japanese corporate barons have other plans, of course, but they will face a fearsome man in Echeverría. If he succeeds, Mexico will achieve that revolutionary goal of standing on its own, free from the interference of foreign capital.\n\nWith himself in charge, of course."

 POLITICS_RAUL_LOZANO_DESC:0 "Raúl Salinas Lozano has found his bread and butter in economics ever since his formal membership into the PRI in 1940. Not only married to an economist, Lozano possesses an extensive laundry list of economic appointments; founder of the National Institute of Public Administration, then becoming head of Economic Studies in the Ministry of Finance until finally landing as the Economics Minister during the López presidency, and whilst Lozano hasn't exactly shared the spotlight for his work, none can doubt the man's talent and prowess.\n\nFollowing the crisis of succession between the protectionist Madrazo and the pro-OFN Ordaz, Lozano has solidified his vision into three core tenets: economic growth with Japanese aid, economic independence from the US, and the end of the extensive corruption of the PRI. A lifelong member of the PRI, Lozano has come to hate the corruption that has constantly plagued the party, from its hypocritical nepotism to the laundering of state funds.\n\nEver the reformer, Lozano now walks a tightrope of his own making, where one fall can spell the beginning of Japanese dominance and another American destruction, which is not even to mention the uphill battle of fighting against the PRI and its armada of corrupt bureaucrats.\n\nNo matter the cost, nothing shall stop Raúl, and Mexico shall witness the glory of the "Salinas Sexenio", for good or for ill."

 POLITICS_GUSTAVO_ORDAZ_DESC:0 "A President doesn't need a flashy story or a rich background nowadays, and there is no better proof of that than Gustavo Díaz Ordaz. A man born into a poor family and shunned even by his mother because of his looks, Ordaz has always been a man that defined himself through hard work and discipline. He worked as a judge in his early '20s, was taken under the wing of future President Avila Camacho during the '30s, became a senator in the '50s, and is now the most powerful person in all of Mexico. Though maybe such a strict man is not the best suited for what is so far the most rebellious decade of the 20th century.\n\nTeenagers have rock and roll. Ordaz has the acoustic guitar. Students want a change. Ordaz seems stuck in the status quo. The world, no matter how hard the Germans and Japanese try to muffle its voice, is clamoring for freedom and democracy. Ordaz will never let PRI hegemony under Mexican politics falter. The workers might try to have their voices heard. Ordaz will be at the ready with his granaderos, just as he did in '59.\n\nThe people might march on the streets, students shall chant "Big mouthed monkey" at him, and he could one day be hated by most in Mexico, but he couldn't care less. He will guide Mexico as he and only he sees it fit and necessary. With some help from Uncle Sam and an iron will, little, if any, will move Ordaz."

 POLITICS_CARLOS_MADRAZO_DESC: "From a distance, Carlos Madrazo is the perfect leader of the PRI and thus the leader of Mexico. Anyone can appreciate a man who challenged his childhood poverty with hard work and determination. And such a long history of activism within the party would give him the respect of those in it. But his oratory skills have caught the attention of the nation ever since secondary school, and have enraptured the youth and workers. Madrazo has already leveraged these advantages to become governor of his Southeastern home state of Tabasco, where his roadways, schools, hospitals, and improved dairy and cacao industries have transformed the land. Most importantly, his vision of a Mexico no longer tied to the slave drivers of the Sphere or the neoimperialists of the OFN has aligned with that of former President López's. With a continuance of economic policy, and his broad electoral support, Madrazo was the obvious pick to become the next leader of Mexico, and to reinvigorate the PRI.\n\nBut Madrazo is not a simple continuance. And that is what alarms many in his own party.\n\nMadrazo is not here to simply be a fresh face for the decaying carcass that is the PRI. He has vowed to remove the corrupt party officials and radically reform the organization. This has united a broad swath of businessmen and party members against him. With no shortage of enemies and few allies, Madrazo's presidency must go through the strongest, oldest structure in Mexico. However, that structure now must withstand the so-called "Southeast Cyclone" that has come to Mexico City."

 MEX_Economic_Battlefield:0 "An Economic Battlefield"
 MEX_Economic_Battlefield_desc:0 "In the revolution's aftermath, our nation almost became an economic pariah for ending the foreign control of our economy through nationalizations and protectionism. Used to the largesses afforded to them during the Porfiriato, moneyed interests in America and beyond lobbied hard against the winners of the Revolution, determined to regain their ascendency over Mexico. The Second World War ended these attempts in a dramatic fashion; dependant on Mexican oil to fuel their desperate war, the Americans gave up on their dreams of economic subjugation.\n\nSince then, Mexico has done very well for itself through neutrality, selling goods and oil to the entire world. Yet this economic miracle has proven itself a double edged sword. Their appetites wetted by the current prosperity, many among the elite dream of using a bidding war between the OFN and the Sphere to increase both their profits and Mexico's international prestige. Already, American business conglomerates and Japanese Zaibatsu clash over hegemony in Mexican affairs. Despite the common people's warriness at moving away from the ideals of the Revolution, it seems some of our politicians scheme of the end of Mexican neutrality."
 MEX_Fraying_Ideals:0 "Fraying Ideals"
 MEX_Fraying_Ideals_desc:0 "The long and bloody upheavals of the Mexican Revolution had not yet ended when the fight over the Revolution's true meaning begun. Had it been a struggle to free Mexican democracy from Porfirio Diaz and his corrupt cientifico clique, or an uprising by the people to end foreign dominance of the economy? There were as many reasons for the revolutions as there were factions within the maelstrom of violence. Eventually, the victors established what would become the PRI, the "Partido Revolucionaro Institucional" or "Institutional Revolutionary Party". These victors proceeded to determine what it all had been about, uniting the divided nation.\n\nNow the PRI has ironically evolved into a creature uncomfortably reminiscent of the old Porfirian oligarchy. As Mexico's one dominant party, the PRI has become a target of foreign schemes to undermine our hard-won economic independence, which has begun to fracture the large coalition of unions, technocrats, and politicians that hold up the party. Many now find themselves embroiled in ideological conflicts, with none more vicous then those that have broken out in the cabinet of Adolfo Mateos. Although no side has the upper hand, one thing is certain: whichever faction wins will determine the Party's, and therefore Mexico's, future."

 MEX_mexican_dictatorship:0 "The Imperfect Dictatorship"
 MEX_mexican_dictatorship_desc:0 "The Janus face of the PRI is one which prefers to present an appearance of democracy and accountability over one of repression. However, as inequality and discontent grow within Mexico, and corruption and factionalism plague the party, the carrot is steadily abandoned in favour of the stick. As PRI rule is dependent on the illusion of democratic structures, this situation cannot remain tenable forever."

 MEX_rural_depression:0 "Revolutionary Agriculture"
 MEX_rural_depression_desc:0 "From the Revolutionary demands for 'Tierra y Libertad', the ejido system of collective agriculture was born. Under it, federally-owned land is allotted to peasant communities, who work the land in common, which initially granted a much greater degree of autonomy to the Mexican peasantry than ever before. However, the system is plagued by political negligence and corruption, and is far less profitable and efficient than modern agronomic practices brought about by the Green Revolution."

 MEX_the_leviathan_4:0 "The Leviathan"
 MEX_the_leviathan_4_desc:0 "The vast party-state bureaucracy of Mexico has loomed over the nation for decades, where worker, peasant and boss alike are all subsumed into a vast net of patronage and administration. While the system has steadily improved the wealth of the nation and standards of living for decades, it has also created pervasive corruption in all aspects of society. Efficiency is consistently sacrificed for political expediency, compounding the financial and administrative burden on the state."

 MEX_mexican_miracle_dummy:0 "Mexican Miracle"
 MEX_mexican_miracle_dummy_desc:0 "Mexico has seen a decade of unparalelled economic growth, never before seen in the country's history. The population boom, the increasingly important presence of the middle class, and the exponential growth of quality of life and private and public businesses show that the last decade's fortune shows no sign of letting up anytime soon. Moreover, the presence of foreign investors from the United States and the Sphere has proven to be a great boon to our continued economic prosperity.\n\nHowever, we must take caution to not let this boon turn into a burden. The government must balance the interest of both foreign and local investors to ensure that this miracle doesn't falter, lest the Mexican dream is lost."
